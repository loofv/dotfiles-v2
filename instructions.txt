Get the config up and running:

Install nvim from terminal.
Follow instructions in nvim on how to initialize, so you get your init.vim file.

Install zsh from terminal. Hit (2) on first run so you get configs.
Install oh-my-zsh according to github instructions.
Install zsh-syntax-highlighting according to github instructions.

Install vim-plug WITHOUT the automatic install in config, do it from command line.
do :PlugInstall in Vim to install plugins.

Now vim with plugins should work, as well as zsh, colors and the theme.

Git settings:
git config --global core.editor "vim"
git config --global core.pager cat
